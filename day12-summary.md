## Day 12 Summary: Whack-a-Box Game

### Features Built:
- Click-based reflex game with scoring and a countdown timer
- Randomly positioned red boxes generated using `Math.random()`
- Boxes disappear after a short time if not clicked
- Game ends after 30 seconds and displays the final score
- Prevents double playing with `start` button disable/enable
- DOM manipulation using `createElement`, `appendChild`, and `onclick`

### Concepts Covered:
- JavaScript game loops (`setInterval`, `setTimeout`)
- Dynamic element positioning and removal
- State management with variables (`score`, `timeLeft`)
- Event-driven programming and user interaction
- Game UI design with CSS positioning

### Next Steps:
- Add difficulty levels (Easy/Medium/Hard)
- Play sound on hit or miss
- Animate the box or add color variation
- Save high scores with `localStorage`
