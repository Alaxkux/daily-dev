## Day 11 Summary: Quote Generator App

### Features Built:
- Displayed random quotes using arrays and `Math.random()`
- Animated each new quote using CSS transitions (`fade-in`)
- Added a "Copy to Clipboard" feature using `navigator.clipboard.writeText()`
- Separated styles into a `style.css` file for better structure
- Handled user interaction with buttons and events (`click` listeners)

### Concepts Covered:
- JavaScript functions and randomness
- DOM manipulation and class toggling
- CSS animations with `@keyframes`
- Clipboard API for copying text
- Forcing reflow using `void el.offsetWidth` to restart animations

### Extra Potential:
- Background color changes with each new quote
- Auto-generate quotes every X seconds
- Save favorite quotes (localStorage)
