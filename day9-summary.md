## Day 9 Summary: Student Directory App

- Worked with arrays of objects (students)
- Used `.filter()` to search and filter lists
- Handled multiple inputs (text + dropdown)
- Built a dynamic UI using `createElement()` and `appendChild()`
- Used DOM events like `input` and `change` to update the view in real-time

### Features Implemented:
- Search students by name
- Filter students by level (100L, 200L, 300L)
- Combined multiple filters together
- Rendered dynamic data to the DOM
